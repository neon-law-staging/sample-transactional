"""Guard the identity that arms auto-merge.

`ci.yml`'s `enable-automerge` job turns on GitHub auto-merge for a green pull
request. WHICH CREDENTIAL IT USES IS NOT COSMETIC: GitHub's workflow-recursion
guard creates no workflow runs for a push attributed to `GITHUB_TOKEN`, and
auto-merge merges as whoever armed it. A merge armed under the run's own token
therefore lands on `main` and starts no workflow at all — not a skipped run, not
a red one: none. `main` moves with nothing having validated it, and no check
anywhere goes red to say so.

That is not hypothetical. `navigator` lost a release to it (its PR #95), and
`neon-law/burshteyn` lost a publish to it twice (PRs #9 and #10), which left
production serving a stale bundle until it was recovered by hand.

These staging repositories carry no `publish.yml`, only this `ci.yml`, so what
the bug costs here is the `ci` validation of every push to `main` rather than a
publish. The failure is the same shape and just as silent, which is why the
guard is the same.

The App is `neon-law-staging-merge-queue` (app id 4683165), owned by
`neon-law-staging` and installed on all of its repositories, so a repository
created later needs no install step. It holds exactly `contents: write` and
`pull_requests: write`, and deliberately no `workflows`: a pull request touching
`.github/workflows/**` therefore cannot be armed by it and is merged by hand —
including the one that introduced this file.

This file is the stdlib port of `navigator`'s `cli/tests/automerge_identity.rs`,
which cannot be reused because these repositories have no Rust workspace. Its
runbook is `navigator`'s `docs/gitops.md` under "Auto-merge identity".

The absence of a fallback is the whole assertion. The shape that caused
navigator's incident was

    GH_TOKEN: ${{ steps.app-token.outputs.token || github.token }}

with the mint step gated on the App secret being present — so an ABSENT secret
skipped the mint and fell through to the losing identity. Fail-open, and
invisible. A missing App must instead skip arming and leave the pull request
visibly waiting for a human; a present but broken App must fail the mint and arm
nothing. Both are fail-closed, and neither can lose a run quietly.

Run by the `ci` job, which is the required status check, so this cannot be
bypassed without editing the required check itself. Stdlib only: CI here
installs no packages before the gate, so there is no YAML parser to lean on and
the job block is extracted by indentation instead.
